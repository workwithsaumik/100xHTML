        <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
        <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
        <p>
            I'm thrilled at the prospect of building and supporting cutting-edge
            technology and solutions with truly global implications. With a
            background in computer science and experience of two projects where I
            got to interact with customers from a variety of countries, I have
            acquired robust problem-solving and communication abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            In one of my positions, I was engaged in the whole life cycle of an
            agricultural cloud project, from initial estimation through building and
            deploying the finished product. I was specifically recognized for
            consistently meeting deadlines and delivering customer deliverables on
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you for your time and consideration. My work experiences, coupled
            with my affinity to be curious and learn, would make me an asset to your
            firm. I can be easily reached at your convenience by email
            <a href="mailto:workwsaumik@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workwsaumik@gmail.com</a>
            or by telephone <a href="tel:+918879358212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(+91)8879358212</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
